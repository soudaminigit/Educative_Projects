Just when I thought nothing could be as offensive and or irritating as a Billy Mays infomercial I had the intellectually shattering experience of renting this piece of garbage Peter Barnes and John Irvin should be brought up on criminal charges for smuggling this script into the public venue The actors need to be charged as accomplices serving no less than a lifetime away from the public eye This production offers the disclaimer For dramatic effect we have taken poetic license with certain facts or some such inadequate statement to fully brace you for the absolute repugnant rewrite of a Bible story which needed no drama added What they did add was enough to make your I Q drop three full points for every five minutes of viewing time The poetic license taken invents characters so bizarre you ll recognize nothing but the names of a few and of course the ark For some reason Noah and Lot are both living in Sodom so maybe Abram was vacationing in Switzerland on a skiing trip Lot is wife played by Carol Kane is a harpy and when she is turned to a pillar of salt Lot breaks off her finger and carries it around in what appears to be an empty baby food jar If that is poetic I m a kumquat When Noah who has now begun drinking wine in quantities that could help float the ark whines about the tough job of the building project he awakens one morning to find that God has delivered enough precut lumber to lighten his burden At least I think it was God It looked like a delivery from 84 Lumber neatly stacked and bundled Maybe 84 Lumber is really an agent for God Rather than bore you with the cargo being loaded I ll regale you with the account of the pirate attack on the ark Incongruous you think This movie is filled with such insulting nonsense After an untold time on the waters Noah spies a pirate ship heading right for them And who might the salty sea captain be Well duh it is Lot of course My only surprise was that his uncle Abram wasn t aboard If you re going to slaughter a plot line slaughter all of it The piracy attempt is unsuccessful and the swashbuckling was pathetic not poetic I think it was around this mark that my nausea prevented me from punishing myself anymore An ugly senseless moronic distortion of anything remotely resembling a Bible account On a scale of 1 10 this movie is premeditated mind abuse Stupid and insulting you ll be more entertained by reading the Yellow Pages 
Let start off by first saying that I have been a punk fan most of my life I always kind of had a lack of respect for the LA scene of the early 80 is which The Decline of Western Civilization documents with the exception of X and Black Flag being more of New York and English punk guy After I saw this movie that completely changed The people shown may look like a bunch of idiotic strung out kids who think they might accomplish something beyond street Cree through their lifestyles but it is a great display of hedonism at it is best coupled with some fun loud rock n roll One of the best scenes and actually most insightful is the interview with Claude Bessy of Catholic Discipline or Kick Boy as he was known to Slash magazine readers Originally from France he rants about punk like a dirty old Frenchman and clues in viewers to many aspects of the punk or DIY attitude to music politics and life in general Darby Crash of the Germs comes off as a complete idiot most of the time but the Germs performance of Manimal is pretty decent complete with a young Pat Smear Black Flag is performance with Chavo Pederast on vocals it was filmed a couple of years before Henry Rollins joined the band is decent and X and FEAR give the best performances in the movie Look out for the interviews with the young punk kids You ll hear some of the funniest things you have ever heard in a documentary Highly recommended 
 Checking Out is an extraordinary film that towers above most film production Its refreshing witty humor is never an excuse to remain superficial To the contrary the film explores multifarious facets of the human spirit and human relations Its warm approach promotes tolerance and acceptance of diversity and recognition of that which unites all people The characters are charming and amusing reflecting those idiosyncrasies that we can all laugh about in ourselves The quick dialog and witty banter will keep you on your toes and you may find yourself trying to contain your own laughter as you won t want to miss a single phrase You ll probably want to see it in the cinema and then again over several more times on video and each time you will discover something new After each viewing you are sure to feel warm and uplifted 
This game show lasted just one season but was intriguing to audiences because it required visual aptitude and a steady hand One false move would disqualify the contestant from winning the prize even though it was clear the contestant knew the correct answer It was always exciting as the contestant began drawing wondering if they would complete the drawing or be buzzed out allowing the other contestant to easily win the contest It was a light hearted show but it was clear that the contestants were often times embarrassed from a silly mistake made unintentionally Rarely seen the game show did not survive past one single season Only a seasoned game show addict will remember this show as it proved to be quite unpopular even though game shows were making a big return to the TV screen after the scandals of the 1950 is game shows But it was a unique concept for a game show and one that has as yet never been seen again 
Comparing this movie to anything by Almodovar is an insult to Almodovar The best thing I can say about it is it tries desperately to be like an Almodovar movie and fails miserably The script is dreadful the characters are one dimensional and the performances are the quality of high school drama except Marcia Gay Harden is which is pretty good given the material she has to work with Furthermore the cinematography does absolutely nothing to convey the whimsical beauty of Gaudi is architecture or the infectious charm of Barcelona If you enjoy the grit pathos and dark quirky comedy of Almodovar is movies you ll find none of them here Spend your money on something other than this waste of celluloid

Spoilers of both this and The Matrix follow I liked the original Matrix a great deal It was not a deep movie despite Fishburne is attempts to philosophize but it was fairly well paced fun and I have a soft spot for Hong Kong fights In the original Neo was the secret life of the rather unhappy cube worker Anderson By day corporate drone and by night brave hacker Eventually he eventually is forced to choose between these lives by his actions does he become an outlaw fighting the machine or does he go back to the safe forgettable world he started in Interestingly he discovers that once one is shorn of illusions life rather sucks He has his girl by his side and his boon companions but he eats processed swill dresses in sweats and lives in a truly skungy bit of machinery Still the truth makes him free At least part of the fun of that first movie lay in the what if it were me questions raised in the viewer is mind What if I were capable of the impossible What if I were The One It does not even matter that much what you are The One example of with a cool title like that Further agent Smith made a wonderful bad guy as he embodied all of the fear of authority that we carry with us He was as unstoppable as a terminator and as merciless At the end of the Matrix Neo must return to the Matrix to share his good news of freedom This movie fails to completely to carry through on the ideas of the original movie and it does so with such lack of gusto such poor scriptwriting and such poor editing that I cannot believe they had planned these changes When the dialog is at a fifth grade level with various long words dropped in randomly I find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying My short list of characterization failures The Oracle goes from mildly helpful if deceitful to utterly obstructionist without any real reason Major personalities of the matrix are introduced without need the keymaster for example was a cute idea but just not that interesting a character Fishburne loses his advisor role and gets nothing to replace it with The people of Zion are not particularly likable nor would you really want them running the world Special effects problems The fight scenes are pointless and intermitable In The Matrix you felt Neo could lose and that he had to become something greater in order to survive In The Matrix Reloaded he is merely the viewpoint character of a particularly poorly plotted video game The fight on the freeway looked quite fake and not that interesting Pacing problems As I mentioned above the fight scenes were interminable The rave went on too long everyone in my row at the theater was looking at their watch Not because we mind good dancing and good orgies but because we did not know about the people pictured nor did we care Whatever hack wrote the creator is soliloquy should be blacklisted from the business It meandered used words that the scriptwriter clearly did not understand and was a waste of time and a pacing killer The creator is speech could have been done in a tenth the time and with more peril as Zion exists to give rebels a place to go so they do not destroy the Matrix There are now too many people who do not believe the matrix is in danger of crashing and killing every person hooked up to it Further the earth cannot support even the people in Zion let alone these others You may choose one person from Zion to form the new Zion while I wipe the memories of the people currently in the Matrix Instead we got a long drawn out bunch of twaddle If someone argues that it is deep ask for a transcript and try breaking down the sentences Each one is too long by several clauses and uses words with clearer shorter synonyms So in summary not worth seeing I have seen the third one and despite what a number of reviewers have said skip it It does not save this turkey The reviewers who feel that the second and third movies were deep should go see some truly deep movies Perhaps read a book or two on rhetoric and debate and perhaps a bit of philosophy This movie is just not hard to understand but it is hard to stomach Scott
Any story comprises a premise characters and conflict Characters plotting their own play promises triumph and a militant character readily lends oneself to this Ardh Satya is premise is summarized by the poem of the same name scripted by Dilip Chitre The line goes ek palde mein napunsaktha doosre palde mein paurush aur teek tarazu ke kaante par ardh satya A rough translation The delicate balance of right wrong commonly seen on the busts of blind justice in the courts has powerlessness on one plate and prowess on another Is the needle on the center a half truth The poem is recited midway in the film by Smita Patil to Om Puri at a resturant It makes a deep impact on the protagonist lays the foundation for much of the later events that follow At the end of the film Om Puri ends up in exactly the same situation described so aptly in the poem The film tries mighty hard to do a one up on the poem However Chitre is words are too powerful and at best the film matches up to the poem in every aspect 
Doesn t anyone bother to check where this kind of sludge comes from before blathering on about its supposed revelations Ask yourself a question Is my skull an open bucket that I allow anyone to dump their propaganda into Do yourself a favor and take a look at the bomb shelter mentality of pathtofreedom com before you waste your time with this screed These sorts of Mother Earth People is Republic of Berkeley urbanite fruitcakes that openly despise a way of life only because it doesn t match theirs must believe their case fails miserably on facts and objectivity Else why resort to willful distortion and blatant one sidedness Pathetic Don t be a sap Take two seconds and cast a skeptical eye before falling for yet more end of the world hysteria from it takes a village types with a political agenda that is probably even to the left of your own Mi Moore rather his unthinking followers have really opened the floodgates with this kind of one sided political trash passed off as a cough documentary But apparently they understand the sentiment of an ever gullible public If it is on a movie screen it must be true God gave you a brain act like you know what you re supposed to do with it
